Description: This package is a set of wrapper functions for phyloseq and
    ggplot2 that turns ordinary taxonomic count data into fantaxtic,
    publication ready plots. Whereas most packages promise to deliver
    figures that could be published directly, in practice they often are
    standard plots output by ggplot2 using the minimal theme. Fantaxtic 
    figures, however, come as completely stylized figures with pleasing 
    colors and maximal plotting control. As the output figures are simply
    ggplot2 objects, expert users can also manipulate the final output
    to customize figures up to their desire.
